It makes sense to do test-driven development because it makes you think about what code does instead of how it does it.

At my current workplace, I am developing an online store in Angular, an application which is very customer facing.

Even if I'm not at the TDD level yet, I try to get high test coverage for my code, avoiding late-night calls about a bug in production and possibly ruining the sleep of my little girl.

Being an online store, I'm working allot with orders and products. Here is a piece of made up code, which I have to test on a daily basis.
